See the main README.md file for specific instructions for running the ICAAhub locally.

To start look for issues with the "Good First Issue" label or create a new issue. 
Create a personal branch of the ICAAhub repository.
Do your homework.
Edit or add code or other files to a new local branch in you fork of the repo.
Create a pull request and link it to the issue you are working on.
The community will review the PR and comment in the issue with feedback, new bugs or workarounds or approval.

My next issue is to make this .md pretty and useful like the main README.md  ;)
